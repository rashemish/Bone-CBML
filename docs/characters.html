            <!-- Character 1 -->
            <div class="fone-bone">
                <img src="images/foneb.png" alt="Image of fone bone" />
                <p>Fone Bone</p>
                <p>The hero of the series, Fone Bone is the most courageous of the Bones but also
                    the youngest. He and his cousin Smiley Bone help their other cousin Phoney Bone
                    escape from Boneville after he upset the villagers, and get stuck in the Valley.
                    He is the most level-headed and the smartest of the three Bone cousins.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 2 -->
            <div class="smiley-bone">
                <img src="images/smileyb.png" alt="Image of smiley bone" />
                <p>Smiley Bone</p>
                <p>The tallest of the Bones, the middle cousin and arguably the least intelligent,
                    he plays a one-string instrument. Smiley is often seen smoking a cigar, and
                    often irritates characters with his simple-mindedness, even when seeking to help
                    people.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 3 -->
            <div class="phoney-bone">
                <img src="images/phoneyb.png" alt="Image of phoney bone" />
                <p>Phoney Bone</p>
                <p>Manipulative and greedy, Phoney Bone is the eldest and least courageous of the
                    Bones and he will do anything to get rich. Run out of Boneville by an angry mob
                    of villagers after trying to run for mayor of Boneville, his greediness and
                    selfishness make an enemy of anyone who crosses him in the Valley.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 4 -->
            <div class="Red-dragon">
                <img src="images/RD.jpeg" alt="Image of The Great Red Dragon" />
                <p>The Great Red Dragon</p>
                <p>The son of the great dragon Mim, The Great Red Dragon is often Fone Bone's
                    last-minute savior. The Red Dragon appears when he is most needed. Gran'ma Ben
                    does not trust him, regardless of how many times he has saved her or her friends
                    from harm. The Great Red Dragon seems to be incredibly ancient. In a sequence
                    that shows the land during the Dragons' reign, supposedly the beginning of time,
                    the Great Red Dragon can be seen fighting Mim along with other dragons.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 5 -->
            <div class="Ted">
                <img src="images/Ted.jpeg" alt="Image of Ted" />
                <p>Ted</p>
                <p>A helpful Acanalonia bivittata, or planthopper, who appears as a recurring
                    supporting character. Often mistaken for a leaf, Ted is the first creature Fone
                    Bone encounters when he enters the valley and the two become fast friends. He
                    harbors a strange link to the Red Dragon and has an older brother who is several
                    hundred times his size. He is able to perform magical enchantments and has the
                    ability to detect Ghost Circles.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 6 -->
            <div class="TOB">
                <img src="images/TOB.jpeg" alt="Image of Ted's Older Brother" />
                <p>Ted's Older Brother</p>
                <p>Ted's big brother is Ted's older brother, the second creature Fone Bone meets in
                    the Valley. He is always there to clean up a problem with Ted, especially if his
                    younger brother is mistaken for a leaf. Not much is known about Ted's older
                    brother, but in Ted's words, "He's actual a real nice guy!"</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Character 7 -->
            <div class="RC">
                <img src="images/RC.jpeg" alt="Image of The Rat Creatures" />
                <p>Rat Creatures</p>
                <p>Two rat creature soldiers, one blue, one brown, who have a particular interest in
                    devouring the Bone cousins, and Fone Bone in particular. The two are rather
                    incompetent, once deserting the army after their disobedience costs Kingdok his
                    arm and later allying with the Bones briefly before returning to their own side.
                    They address each other as "comrade".</p>
