                    <div class="caption">Hi all! My name is Dannika Love and I am a second-year DIGIT student at Penn State Behrend! I am the daughter of Jodie and Ron Love, I have an older sister, Kalie, along with a brother-in-law, Dan. I enjoy being creative whether it be painting, a craft or anything artistic. I enjoy to cook and bake, along with just having time to relax on my phone. I am a really big family person, I love my family so much, I currently live two hours from home to go to college and it is not the easiest thing to do. I enjoy hanging out with my family and my high sweetheart boyfriend, Gavin, along with his family. I love going to see my grandma, who is an absolute hoot. This is just a little about me.

I love fashion and sci-fi and find that many of my personal design projects are based on said subjects. Currently, I have opened up myself to web development and enjoy building my personal digital designs from scratch! Thanks for checking out our project :)
