         <description> The first volume in the acclaimed "Bone" series, this story follows the journey of the three Bone                  cousins; Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone, as they are forced to flee their hometown and find themselves lost in          a mysterious valley. As this story blends humour, adventure, and fantasy, this volume sets the stage for an epic tale
         filled with rich storytelling and capitivating artwork.</description>
